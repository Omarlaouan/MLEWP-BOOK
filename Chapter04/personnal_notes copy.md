# Chapter 04 : Packaging 

### Why package? 
- User-fiednly : Being able to run the code without knowledge about it implementation.
- Scalability (write eonce, use many): if your package is used by 40 projects and there is a bug -> you fix the bud 1 time, redelploy/update the package for the 40 projects
- Simplifying CI/CD deployment
